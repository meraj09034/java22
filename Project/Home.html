              <h2>Universities in Bangladesh</h2>
              <p>Universities in Bangladesh represent about 75 academic bodies out of a total of about 105 institutions of the conventional higher education institution (HEI) in Bangladesh. Segmented by management and financial structure, these include 34 public universities, 85 private universities, 2 international universities, 31 specialized colleges, and 2 special universities. There are specialized universities in both categories offering courses principally in technological studies, medical studies, business studies and Islamic studies. There are two private universities dedicated solely to female students. The number of universities is growing mostly in and around the capital city of Dhaka.</p>
              <p>There are about 1688 colleges organized under the umbrella of Bangladesh National University â€” one of the largest in the world. The Open University offers distance learning courses. There is a parallel religious high-ed education system.</p>
              <p>The University Grants Commission of Bangladesh (UGC) is the regulatory body of all the public (government funded) and private universities of Bangladesh. The Private University Act of 1992 paved the way for vigorous sprouting of private universities. 80% of its universities are in their infancy. There is a severed shortage in higher education capacity. The country is yet to have any research and education network (REN) or digital library consortium (DLC).</p>
